# Solid Diffusion

Minimalist web-based interface for Stable Diffusion with persistant storage in the browser, built with SolidJS.

This project is an **__alpha test__**. It has not been heavily stress-tested, and is likely to change in the future as the backend dependencies continue to evolve.

Come back later when it's done-er for the best experience!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Solid Diffusion is only a frontend, so it requires another piece of software to do the dreaming.

Currently, only the [lstein fork](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/) of Stable Diffusion is supported. 

You must **already have this configured and working** before you can set up Solid Diffusion.

### Setup instructions

1. Download the latest build of `index.html` from [Releases](https://github.com/nderscore/solid-diffusion/releases)

1. Copy it into the `static/dream_web/` of your lstein `stable-diffusion`

1. Launch the dream server with the `--web` flag: `python scripts/dream.py --web`

1. Visit the address that appears in the terminal in your browser.
